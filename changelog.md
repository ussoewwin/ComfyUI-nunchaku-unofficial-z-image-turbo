## Version 3.5.0

- **Added**: **HSWQ Model Patch Loader** (`HSWQModelPatchLoaderCustom`) - Load model patches (ControlNet, feature projectors, etc.) with **CPU offload** and **ConvRot INT8** support. INT8 weights stay in VRAM (`QuantizedTensor` / `TensorWiseINT8Layout`, comfy-kitchen `int8_linear` with online ConvRot rotation); `cpu_offload` builds the patch in CPU main memory; compute dtype auto-selects BF16 (Ampere+) / FP16 (Turing). Ported from ComfyUI-NunchakuFluxLoraStacker `ModelPatchLoaderCustom`; apply with the stock apply nodes (`QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet` / `ZImageFunControlnet` / `USOStyleReference`).
- **Fixed**: **SAM3 / SAM3.1 ConvRot INT8 support** - restored the comfy_kitchen INT8 unaligned-GEMM fallback (layers whose K/N is not a multiple of 4, e.g. SAM3 `boxRPB_embed_x` K=2, dequantize to float instead of crashing `cublas_gemm_int8`; weights stay INT8 in VRAM) and the SAM3 load patches: `process_clip_state_dict` key remap for pre-split `language_backbone` (fixes "clip missing" -> corrupt text embeddings -> empty/black masks) and SAM3-gated `load_state_dict_guess_config` handling (CLIP/Conv2d keys dequantized, all Linear layers stay true INT8). Stock ComfyUI SAM3/SAM3.1 nodes now load ConvRot INT8 checkpoints correctly (verified on both SAM3 and SAM3.1).
- See [Release Notes v3.5.0](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.5.0) for details.

## Version 3.4.9

- **Improved**: **Dynamic Compute Dtype in HSWQ ControlNet Loader (`HSWQControlNetLoader`) for Turing (sm_75) & Legacy GPU Compatibility** — Resolved potential BF16 runtime errors and implicit FP32 upcasting on NVIDIA Turing (RTX 2000 / GTX 1600 series) and older architectures that lack native BF16 hardware Tensor Cores.
  - **Dynamic Architecture Detection**: Uses `comfy.model_management.should_use_bf16()` to automatically select `torch.bfloat16` on modern GPUs (Ampere / Ada / Blackwell) while safely selecting `torch.float16` on Turing / Pascal architectures.
  - **Uncompromised INT8 VRAM Savings**: Keeps quantized weights strictly in 8-bit (`TensorWiseINT8Layout`) in VRAM, eliminating unnecessary FP32 memory overhead while providing maximum VRAM reduction across all GPU generations.
  - **Full Backwards Compatibility**: Zero changes to node inputs, outputs, or existing workflows; non-quantized and FP8 fallback paths remain completely transparent.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.9](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.9) for details.

## Version 3.4.8

- **Removed**: **HSWQ SAM3 Loader (ConvRot INT8) & HSWQ SAM3 Detect nodes** - the SAM3 node work (loader, detect node, patches, guides) was removed from the tree. Testing (and community confirmation on r/StableDiffusion) showed the dedicated loader is **not required**: the startup patch (`_patch_load_state_dict_guess_config_int8`, `is_sam3` gate) already makes stock loaders (`CheckpointLoaderSimple` / default Comfy SAM3.1 node) handle ConvRot INT8 SAM3 checkpoints automatically, including MixedPrecisionOps attachment and CLIP key remapping. The tree is restored to baseline `d33862a` (`191ddbc`); all technical work (patches, nodes, technical guide) remains in the git history for reference.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.8](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.8) for details.

## Version 3.4.6

- **Fixed**: **SDXL anytest LoRA-type ControlNet (ControlLora) on ConvRot INT8 / Hybrid ConvRot NVFP4 bases** - two-stage root fix (symptom: control first had no effect, then locked the output onto the lineart - B&W, no coloring, dead strength slider):
  - **ControlLora borrowed-weight dequant v3** (`c60bb0b`, `patches/comfy_quant_int8.py` + `__init__.py`): `ControlLora.pre_run` borrows the base UNet's state_dict into a float control model; with quantized bases those weights were garbage - comfy-kitchen's ConvRot dequant is 2D-only (4D Conv2d -> `NoCapableBackendError` -> raw +-127 qdata fallback) and HSWQ-armed Conv2d weights live in the rotated basis (`qt.dequantize()` returns W_rot). The v3 wrapper now dequantizes per-module (qdata x scale) and un-rotates 4D Conv2d weights, and is installed unconditionally at startup.
  - **`HSWQCheckpointLoaderSDXL` INT8 routing** (`152c1dc`, `__init__.py`): the node called `load_checkpoint_guess_config` directly and ignored `weight_dtype="int8_tensorwise"`. ConvRot INT8 checkpoints store Conv2d quant layers as raw int8 qdata + `weight_scale` + `comfy_quant` sidecars (groupsize 64); without the INT8 Conv2d load scope they stayed RAW (+-127) - the base UNet forward broke (NaN) and the ControlLora control output exploded `[731, 123352, 183752, NaN]` -> output locked onto the lineart. The node now delegates int8_tensorwise (or auto-detected comfy_quant INT8) to the INT8-aware `load_checkpoint_sdxl_hswq_weight_dtype`. Also fixed the Hadamard device mismatch in `_unrotate_conv2d` (CPU/CUDA crash inside `ControlLora.pre_run` during sampling).
  - **Docs**: `md/HSWQ_SDXL_ANYTEST_CONTROLLORA_CONVROT_INT8_NVFP4_FIX_GUIDE.md` rewritten (v2): root cause, code, verification (control norms sane `[720, 1229, 1415, 1553]`, end-to-end colored generation sat 73.5, structure L1 0.299).
- **Changed**: HSWQ ControlNet Loader renamed to `HSWQControlNetLoader` with aliases (`HSWQLoadConvRotINT8ControlNet`) and `loaders` category (`d208c58`).
- See [Release Notes v3.4.6](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.6) for details.

## Version 3.4.5

- **Fixed**: **Z Image tcon (TC/W4A4) NVFP4 2nd-generation noise after DisTorch HSWQ purge** — after a full HSWQ purge, the 2nd generation of tcon NVFP4 models baked with `nvfp4_baked=0 other_qt_baked=83` (NVFP4 layers misclassified as `other_qt`, ConvRot unrotate/re-rotate skipped) and produced noise. Two-part root fix:
  - **`_load_wrap_ok` gate** in `apply_comfy_quant_nvfp4_patches()` (`nodes/zimage_nvfp4/zi_comfy_quant_nvfp4.py`): the early-return now also verifies the purge-peelable `ops._load_quantized_module` wrap is still armed (`_hswq_nvfp4_full_load` stamp). If the purge peeled it, execution falls through to the full re-apply (re-wrap + `arm_nvfp4_module`) instead of trusting the stale `_PATCHES_APPLIED` flag, so `_hswq_nvfp4_convrot` is re-armed on reload and NVFP4 layers bake correctly again.
  - **`_install_permanent_dynamic_load_guard()`** (`nodes/zimage_nvfp4/load_unet.py`): a permanent outer `ModelPatcherDynamic.load` guard that is **not** stamped `_hswq_zi_nvfp4_lora_bake`, so the purge deep-clean walks past it; on every `Dynamic.load` it re-arms the ConvRot NVFP4 LoRA bake hook via `_ensure_dynamic_load_bake_wrap()` (no-op when already armed).
  - **Docs**: `md/HSWQ_TCON_NVFP4_SECOND_GEN_NOISE_FIX.md` — complete guide (problem, root cause, files, full code, code meaning) against baseline `1156f00`.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.5](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.5) for details.
## Version 3.4.4

- **Added**: **HSWQ ControlNet Loader (ConvRot INT8)** (`HSWQControlNetLoader` / `HSWQLoadConvRotINT8ControlNet`) — Loads ConvRot / TensorWise INT8-quantized ControlNet checkpoints (e.g., Qwen Image Fun ControlNet) keeping weights INT8 in VRAM with `comfy_kitchen` `int8_linear` execution. Resolves stock ComfyUI `controlnet_load_state_dict` INT8 initialization crashes by forcing BF16 module graph construction with explicit `int8_tensorwise` MixedPrecisionOps injection.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.4](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.4) for details.

## Version 3.4.3

- **Added**: **Z Image Hybrid ConvRot NVFP4 — Tensor Core (TC / W4A4) opt-in path**. The Z Image Linear hot path can now run as **W4A4 TC** (NVFP4 weights × 4-bit rotated activations on the raw `cublas_gemm_blockwise_fp4` GEMM) instead of the previous **Comfy parity W4A16** (NVFP4 weights × fp16 activations). Gated by **trajectory-fidelity validation** — final-cos ≈ parity (0.951 vs 0.952, 0 bifurcation) — so TC adds no systematic quality loss while unlocking the Tensor Core speedup.
  - **`input_scale` calibration**: TC requires a per-layer calibrated `input_scale` (measured `amax / 2688` in the rotated domain, standalone `calib_input_scale_nvfp4.py` step — not histogram-searched). Forcing TC on an uncalibrated checkpoint collapses quality.
  - **Loader opt-in priority**: `HSWQ_ZI_FORCE_PARITY=1` > `HSWQ_ZI_FORCE_TC=1` > auto-detect `*.input_scale`; `checkpoint_has_input_scale()` / `zi_use_tensorcore()` gate the path.
  - **GEMM-mode clarity**: addmm (`scaled_mm` hits vs dequant fallbacks) + parity/TC forward counters make the active mode unambiguous in logs.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.3](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.3) for details.

## Version 3.4.2

- **Fixed**: **HSWQ Torch Compile** crash on Japanese Windows — `BackendCompilerFailed` (`AssertionError: Mixing fake modes NYI`, backend=`inductor`) during USDU + Lumina2 NVFP4 + HSWQ Torch Compile, with two root causes fixed:
  - **`Mixing fake modes NYI`**: the NVFP4 FP4 dequant LUT (`F.embedding`) re-entered the dispatcher under inductor AOT fake tracing. `hswq::dequantize_nvfp4` is now a `torch.library.custom_op` with a `register_fake` meta kernel (numerics identical).
  - **cp932 `UnicodeDecodeError`**: torch inductor's `load_template` reads `*.py.jinja` via a bare `open()` on the Windows ANSI code page. A new idempotent `win_utf8_patch.py` (loaded from `prestartup_script.py` and `__init__.py`) forces UTF-8, so `torch.compile(backend="inductor")` now runs without `PYTHONUTF8=1` / `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.2](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.2) for details.

## Version 3.4.1

- **Added / Published**: **Z Image / ZIT Hybrid ConvRot NVFP4** quantization method and published models. Hybrid packs combine **Linear NVFP4 (Tensor Core `scaled_mm_nvfp4`)** with **INT8-protected (Conv2d / sensitivity-selected) layers**, loaded through the **HSWQ ConvRot INT8/ConvRot NVFP4 UNet Loader** (`weight_dtype`: `ConvRot NVFP4`) on the bench-matched **Comfy parity** path (stock GEMM + online act rotate), separate from the SDXL Tensor Core product path. Published models: `Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization-Z-Image-Hybrid-ConvRot-NVFP4`. README now lists all published HSWQ packs (SDXL ConvRot INT8 / SDXL ConvRot NVFP4 / Z Image ConvRot NVFP4).
- See [Release Notes v3.4.1](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.1) for details.

## Version 3.4.0

- **Added**: **SDXL ConvRot NVFP4 Blackwell Tensor Boost** — Per-Weight CUDA Graph auto-dispatch on SM >= 100 (B200 / GB200, RTX 5090 / SM120) inside `nodes/nvfp4/` only (Z Image / INT8 / FP8 / stock paths untouched). Eliminates shape-shared weight `.copy_()` on replay; adaptive `M` cap 16384; capture / hit console logs and `nvfp4_forward_stats()` (`blackwell_graph_hits`, `blackwell_tensor_boost_active`). Independent **`tensor_boost` BOOLEAN** on **HSWQ Sampler** and **HSWQ Ultimate SD Upscale** (default OFF; Loader has no toggle) via `HSWQ_NVFP4_TENSORBOOST` / `HSWQ_NVFP4_CUDAGRAPH`, with `clear_nvfp4_cudagraphs()` on OFF so USDU tiles avoid VRAM blow-up. **ON raises VRAM by several GB** (CUDA Graph arenas) — **RTX 5090 32 GB+** recommended for upscale / Tensor Boost headroom; sampler path **16 GB+**. Docs: `md/HSWQ_SDXL_NVFP4_BLACKWELL_ACCELERATION_GUIDE.md`.
- See [Release Notes v3.4.0](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.4.0) for details.

## Version 3.3.9

- **ComfyUI 0.30.2 compatibility & Krea2 parity contamination** (commits `21792a8`..`ecd6bc0`):
  - **Perf**: Krea2 ConvRot INT8 GPU-cached Hadamard matrices (`native_convert_int8.get_hadamard_on_device`), 200-module early exit for full-model INT8/SVDQ scans, `mixed_precision_ops` re-entry guards, and `disabled` set normalization.
  - **Perf / VRAM**: ZI NVFP4 `load_models_gpu` bake hook fast-skip (no patches + no baked keys -> skip; non-dynamic model -> skip), reducing VRAM pressure from redundant full-diagnostics on every GPU load.
  - **Perf**: Krea2 ConvRot INT8 progressive slowdown across runs (1st ~4s/step, 2nd 4s->16s->22s->26s/step) **fixed**. Root cause: Z Image `comfy_parity` wrappers left on `mixed_precision_ops` / `_load_quantized_module` armed `_hswq_int8_convrot` on Krea2 INT8 ConvRot layers and installed `forward_parity` (online Hadamard act rotate) on every Linear -> unnecessary rotation every step -> CUDA fragmentation worsening each run. Fix: `_clear_zimage_parity_contamination_for_sdxl()` called before Krea2 stock load (same as SDXL path).
  - **Compat**: `Parameter.data` unwrap for ComfyUI 0.30.2 lazy weight repr, `comfy.weight_adapter.lora` import fallback, `calculate_weight` `intermediate_dtype` default = `torch.float32`, `LowVramPatch.__call__` `original_weights` kwarg, `state_dict` `extra_quant_params`.
  - **Docs**: Technical guide `md/HSWQ_COMFYUI_0_30_2_COMPATIBILITY_FIX_GUIDE.md` covering all root causes, fixes, and verification.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.9](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.9) for details.

## Version 3.3.8

- **Added**: **HSWQ Sampler** `clip_perfect_offload (Krea2 only)` toggle — frees the Krea2 text encoder before sampling (drops its patcher from `current_loaded_models`) to reach bench-parity VRAM on tight cards. Krea2-scoped both ways via the loader tag `_hswq_is_krea2` and exact `comfy.text_encoders.krea2` module identity (no class-name guessing); off by default, strict boolean read, no global allocator ops, and any failure is caught so a run never breaks. UI widget now shows the `(Krea2 only)` scope tag. Docs: EN/ZH README node sections and new `md/HSWQ_KREA2_TE_OFFLOAD_GUIDE.md`.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.8](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.8) for details.

## Version 3.3.7

- **Fixed / Changed (license & provenance)**: Dropped leftover Apache-2.0 wording so this loader repo is consistently **GPL-3.0**; clarified that upstream **HSWQ** ([Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization)) remains **AGPL-3.0** and is separate from this package’s license. Reworked README / zhmd provenance for **USDU**, **Torch Compile (KJNodes)**, and **Batched Detailer (Impact Pack)** without “copy” phrasing. Batched Detailer now ships helpers in `nodes/batched_detailer_lib/` so Impact Pack is **not** required at runtime while GPL attribution remains.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.7](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.7) for details.

## Version 3.3.6

- **Added / Fixed**: **HSWQ Torch Compile** node (`HSWQTorchCompileModel`) — ComfyUI `set_torch_compile_wrapper` path without KJNodes; forces `compile_threads=1` and `worker_start_method=subprocess` so SeedVR2 / `utils.install_util` spawn crashes stay off; defaults inductor + `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs`. **ZI INT8 peel**: `peel_non_product_nvfp4_ops` dives under PRODUCT NVFP4 load when the under layer is foreign INT8 / ZI protect, so SDXL INT8 survives after Z Image. Docs: EN/ZH README node sections, technical guide, BETA badge removed.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.6](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.6) for details.

## Version 3.3.5

- **Fixed / Changed**: Large Z Image ConvRot NVFP4 hardening after v3.3.4 — peel Z Image into dedicated `nodes/zimage_nvfp4` (no shared ownership with SDXL `nodes/nvfp4` Tensor Core product); separate dropdown **`Z Image ConvRot NVFP4`** vs SDXL **`ConvRot NVFP4`** and branch Dynamic VRAM LoRA bake accordingly; clear Z Image **comfy_parity** load overlay + in-place Linear bake (**VER=8**) + INT8-protect arm residue when returning to SDXL INT8 / SDXL ConvRot NVFP4 so salt-pepper, LoRA fall-off, and full noise after SDXL → Z Image → SDXL no longer stick.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.5](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.5) for details.

## Version 3.3.4

- **Fixed**: Z Image / ZIT **ConvRot NVFP4** / INT8 protect — after **Distorch** purge, module-local `_hswq_nvfp4_parity_H` reused under a weaker gate than global `_tensor_storage_ok` → **2nd+ gen** quality decay. Parity now shares `_tensor_storage_ok`.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.4](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.4) for details.

## Version 3.3.3

- **Fixed**: Z Image hybrid packs (**ConvRot NVFP4** + **ConvRot INT8 protect**) — Dynamic VRAM LoRA bake now covers **both** Linear families. INT8 protect is armed like Conv2d (clear kitchen `Params.convrot`, keep False after requant); dual bake + pass-delta EVIDENCE (`NVFP4_LORA_BAKE_*` / `INT8_PROTECT_LORA_BAKE_*`) so leftover LowVramPatch on protect layers no longer leaves dead LoRA or noise.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.3](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.3) for details.

## Version 3.3.2

- **Fixed**: Z Image / ZIT **ConvRot NVFP4** salt-and-pepper noise on the **2nd generation after a DistOrch VRAM purge**. INT8 decode wrap was dropping NVFP4 stack markers, so a later “upgrade” re-wrapped the Tensor Core product path over the Comfy parity stack; DistOrch refresh then peeled only the TC layer and left **double online act rotate** on reload. Markers are preserved through the INT8 wrap so parity refresh no longer re-arms a second rotate.
- See [Release Notes v3.3.2](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.2) for details.

## Version 3.3.1

- **Added**: Z Image / ZIT **ConvRot NVFP4** support on **HSWQ ConvRot INT8/ConvRot NVFP4 UNet Loader** (`weight_dtype`: `ConvRot NVFP4`, or `default` with NVFP4 auto-detect). Uses the bench-matched Comfy parity path (stock MixedPrecision GEMM + online act rotate) under `nodes/zimage_nvfp4`, including mixed NVFP4 + INT8 protect packs and Dynamic VRAM LoRA bake — not the SDXL Checkpoint Loader Tensor Core product path. **Supported only for models quantized with [Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization).**
- See [Release Notes v3.3.1](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.1) for details.

## Version 3.3.0

- **Changed**: Remaining ComfyUI node class IDs renamed from Nunchaku-prefixed names to HSWQ-prefixed IDs (`HSWQSaveImage`, `HSWQCheckpointLoaderSDXL`, `HSWQSDXLLoraStackV3`, `HSWQZImageDiTLoader`, and related JS hooks).
- See [Release Notes v3.3.0](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.3.0) for details.

## Version 3.2.9

- **Changed**: `pyproject.toml` `[project].name` updated to match the new repository identity so the ComfyUI registry category is **comfyui-hswq-loader-and-tools**.
- **Changed**: Re-registered the node pack with ComfyUI under the corrected project name.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.9](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.9) for details.

## Version 3.2.8

- **Changed**: Repository renamed to **ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools**.
- **Changed**: Node renamed from **HSWQ&Nunchaku Ultimate SD Upscale** to **HSWQ Ultimate SD Upscale** (class, ID, and title).
- See [Release Notes v3.2.8](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.8) for details.

## Version 3.2.7

- **Removed**: In-node INT8 W8A8 Triton Linear acceleration (Plan B) — fused kernels, `install.py` Triton stage, and the **Triton accelerate** UI toggle. INT8 Linear speed now relies on ComfyUI + `comfy_kitchen` (`int8_linear` cuda → triton → eager). This extension keeps INT8 load compatibility patches only (Conv2d / LoRA / ControlLora / handoff).
- See [Release Notes v3.2.7](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.7) for details.

## Version 3.2.6

- **Added**: Public INT8 W8A8 Triton Linear acceleration (Plan B) for HSWQ INT8 loaders — fused row-wise activation quant → INT8 GEMM → dequant without relying on Comfy `--enable-triton-backend`; Windows/Linux Triton install in `install.py`; UI toggle **Triton accelerate**; tiled rowwise quant so wide layers (e.g. K=10240) stay on the fused path.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.6](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.6) for details.

## Version 3.2.5

- **Fixed**: `requirements.txt` install failure on outdated portable/embedded Python environments — a transitive, wheel-less source dependency (`filterpy`, pulled by `facexlib`) forced a source build that crashed with `AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'` on Python 3.12+ because the environment shipped an old `setuptools`. An `install.py` now upgrades `pip` / `setuptools` / `wheel` before installing `requirements.txt`, so ComfyUI-Manager install/update repairs the build tooling first and the legacy source build succeeds.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.5](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.5) for details.

## Version 3.2.4

- **Fixed**: SDXL LoRA-type ControlNet (e.g. `anytest`) producing all-black output under INT8 quantization — `ControlLora.pre_run` borrowed the INT8 base UNet weights via `diffusion_model.state_dict()`, which returned flattened raw `int8`/`uint8` tensors instead of `QuantizedTensor`, so the borrowed weights were never dequantized. The patch intercepts that `state_dict()` and dequantizes the INT8 base weights on the fly (full-weight ControlNets such as `canny` were unaffected, and the issue did not occur in FP8).
- See [Release Notes v3.2.4](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.4) for details.

## Version 3.2.3

- **Added**: **HSWQ Sampler** — a KSampler-equivalent node that behaves exactly like the standard ComfyUI KSampler, but automatically adds all of RES4LYF's samplers and schedulers when [RES4LYF](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF) is installed. It reproduces Forge's dynamic sampler generation so the full Runge-Kutta (`rk_beta`) sampler family stays selectable and runnable in vanilla ComfyUI.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.3](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.3) for details.

## Version 3.2.2

- **Fixed**: INT8→Nunchaku VRAM handoff false-positive on non-SVDQ loads (including SDXL INT8 normal generation) — SVDQ detection no longer uses bare `"nunchaku" in __module__` (this extension’s INT8 Conv2d path contains that substring); handoff `_VER = 10` arms only for real Nunchaku SVDQ on the BaseModel, and native comfy_quant INT8 (any architecture) never arms handoff.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.2](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.2) for details.

## Version 3.2.1

- **Fixed**: INT8 HSWQ (Dynamic VRAM) → Nunchaku SVDQ coexistence Abort — LowVramPatch and Dynamic LoRA bake restricted to `comfy.quant_ops.QuantizedTensor` only (never bare `torch.int8`); unidirectional VRAM handoff uses `detach(unpatch_all=True)` before SVDQ load.
- **Removed**: Reintroduced **HSWQ Pin Buffer Cache** again (not required for the Abort fix; Detailer-scoped pin pooling remains obsolete after AIMDO HostBuffer).
- **Docs**: Rewrote `md/HSWQ_INT8_NUNCHAKU_COEXISTENCE_GUIDE.md` for verified Abort causes vs PinCache correlation.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.1](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.1) for details.

## Version 3.2.0

- **Removed**: **HSWQ Pin Buffer Cache** (`nodes/hswq_pin_cache.py` and Detailer `hswq_pin_cache_scope`) — redundant after ComfyUI Dynamic VRAM / AIMDO `HostBuffer` updates (no thrashing `unpin` path). Batched Detailer three-phase flow kept; use native ComfyUI pin behavior.
- **Changed**: Display title forced to **HSWQ Checkpoint Loader (SDXL)** for the SDXL checkpoint loader node.
- See [Release Notes v3.2.0](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.2.0) for details.

## Version 3.1.9

- **Added**: Native **comfy_quant INT8** (`int8_tensorwise`) load path for SDXL checkpoints — **HSWQ FP8/INT8 Loader (VRAM Opt)** auto-detects INT8 vs Scaled FP8; **HSWQ FP8 E4M3 UNet Loader** gains `int8_tensorwise` / auto-detect. Extension-side Conv2d quant support and INT8-safe LoRA bake under Dynamic VRAM.
- See [Release Notes v3.1.9](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.1.9) for details.

## Version 3.1.8

- **Added**: **HSWQ Save Image** (`NunchakuSaveImage`) — save `IMAGE` output as PNG or JPG (JPEG quality when JPG is selected).
- **Added**: **Nunchaku Ultimate SD Upscale** — `upscale_by` dropdown with **Auto** mode and `target_height` (default 4320) to derive scale from input height; fixed magnifications 0.05–4.00 remain available.
- See [Release Notes v3.1.8](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.1.8) for details.

## Version 3.1.7

- **Fixed**: Critical fix for severe output noise and `RuntimeError` in `NunchakuUltimateSDUpscale` when used with Lumina/HunYuan-DiT architectures. Corrected the conditioning tensor slicing logic to accurately extract T5/LLM features from concatenated tensors.
- See [Release Notes v3.1.7](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.1.7) for details.

## Version 3.1.3

- **Fixed**: Workaround for `RuntimeError` in `NunchakuUltimateSDUpscale` caused by a recent ComfyUI core change that concatenates multi-encoder conditioning along the feature dimension (e.g., 7680 instead of 2560) for Lumina/HunYuan-based models. Added automatic detection and truncation of these embeddings before sampling.
- See [Release Notes v3.1.3](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.1.3) for details.

## Version 3.1.2

- **Fixed**: Pin Buffer Cache (monkey-patch for `comfy.pinned_memory.pin_memory` / `unpin_memory`) is now enabled only while running `HSWQ Batched Detailer (SEGS)`. Outside of Detailer SEGS, the extension delegates back to ComfyUI's original pin/unpin behavior to avoid side effects in other nodes/workflows.

## Version 3.1.1

- **Fixed**: Bug fixes and corrections (loader registration, zimage model handling, USDU crop model patch).
- See [Release Notes v3.1.1](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.1.1) for details.

## Version 3.1.0

- **Added** two new nodes:
  - **HSWQ FP8 E4M3 UNet Loader** (`HSWQFP8E4M3UNetLoader`) — Standard UNet loader for HSWQ FP8 E4M3 models; extension also installs a Pin Buffer Cache to reduce `cudaHostRegister`/`cudaHostUnregister` overhead under Dynamic VRAM Loading.
  - **HSWQ Batched Detailer (SEGS)** — Detailer (SEGS)–style node that runs VAE encode → UNet sample → VAE decode in three phases (all encodes, then all samples, then all decodes) to minimize model switching and improve performance with Dynamic VRAM Loading.
- See [Release Notes v3.1.0](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for details.

## Version 3.0.2

- **README**: FP8 (fp8e4m3) and torch.compile subsection updated — purpose (use this node with FP8 and torch.compile together) and patches description.
- See [Release Notes v3.0.2](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Loader-and-Tools/releases/tag/3.0.2) for details.

## Version 3.0.0

- **Breaking**: Aligned with SDXL SVDQ deprecation (see IMPORTANT NOTICE at top). Node registration reduced to the following three only:
  - **Nunchaku-ussoewwin SDXL Integrated Loader** (Checkpoint Loader style: single checkpoint)
  - **Nunchaku-ussoewwin SDXL DiT Loader (DualCLIP)** (UNet + CLIP from separate files)
  - **Nunchaku Ultimate SD Upscale**

  - Nunchaku-ussoewwin Z-Image-Turbo DiT Loader
  - Nunchaku-ussoewwin SDXL LoRA Stack V3
  - Nunchaku Apply First Block Cache Patch Advanced
- Future SDXL workflows are intended to use fp8e4m3 with standard ComfyUI loaders where applicable.

## Version 2.6.6

- **Fixed**: Fixed `AttributeError: 'Logger' object has no attribute 'mgpu_mm_log'` error that was causing prompt execution to crash. Replaced all instances of `logger.mgpu_mm_log()` with `logger.info()` in `model_management_mgpu.py`, `device_utils.py`, and `wrappers.py`.
